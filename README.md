## INFO 8000 term project
### Data Acquisition
COV-19 sequence were retreved  from NCBI Genbank with select using Bio.Entrez
Using length > 20000bp to filter the whole genome sequences

### Modeling
Sequence alignment is used with Mafft in python

Sequence data will be translated into numerical

Sequence classification will be performed using K-Nearest Neighbors

### Data Storage
Build a database to select the dataset used for modeling

### Data Visualization
A dataset description using sequence metadata

### Web APIs
Deploy dataset description and classification output to webpage
